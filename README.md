Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerability

# AIM:
To exploit SQL Injection vulnerability using Multidae web application in Metasploitable2

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode


### Step 2:

Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows:

### Step 3:

Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:
SQL Injection is a sort of infusion assault that makes it conceivable to execute malicious SQL statements. These statements control a database server behind a web application. Assailants can utilize SQL Injection vulnerabilities to sidestep application safety efforts. They can circumvent authentication and authorization of a page or web application and recover the content of the whole SQL database. Identify IP address using ifconfig in Metasploitable2

Use the above ip address to access the apache webserver of Metasploitable2 from kali linux. In Kali Linux use the ip address in a web browser.
